# IDEs

I'm on the IntelliJ camp. Since I likely have more than one JetBrains IDE installed, I manage them with [Jetbrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app)

After downloading and unpacking I place the tool in `/usr/local/bin`

Before starting make sure that the `/usr/local/src` dir is owned by `$USER`:

    sudo chown -r $USER:$USER /usr/local/src

Now run it and click the settings icon (gear shape in the top-right) to:

* set the location on disk (I rather not have 3rd party binaries in my home dir)
* improve privacy by not allowing data sharing
