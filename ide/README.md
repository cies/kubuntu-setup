# IDEs

I'm on the IntelliJ camp. Since I likely have more than one JetBrains IDE installed, I manage them with [Jetbrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app)

After installing the Toolbox, run it and click the settings icon (gear shape in the top-right) to set the location on disk (I rather not have 3rd party binaries in my home dir).
