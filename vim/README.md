# SpaceVim

I went from whatever to Vim for it's everywhere and does the trick. To Emacs with eVIl as a good editor needs a serious operating system. Now I code mostly in IntelliJ, with IdeaVim, obviously.

When using Emacs I found Spacemacs and it kind of got stuck. Using some keyboard friendly menus to get stuff done while you slowly work on remembering more shortcuts.

Now I use SpaceVim, which works with Vim and NeoVim. No more operating system. Just a quick starting editor with some egonomics that works everywhere.

I have a rule: editors presented in white are modeless (CTRL-Z,X,C,V,A etc.), dark editors allow for modal, vim-style, editing.
